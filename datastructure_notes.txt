Overall FPGA Architecture:
	- FPGA is implemented as a graph of LUTs 



Specific Data Strutures:
	- LUTs
		- Each LUT is implemented as an instance of the LUT class
		- Inside the LUT class 

	- AvailableConnections matrix: numpy array of size (num_luts x num_luts)
		- Represents the POSSIBLE connections for LUTs (actual connections are handled locally)
		- The j'th column of the i'th row is 1 if the output of LUT i can be
		  an input to LUT j. If not, it is 0
		- Note that this matrix is NOT diagonal. The output of one LUT being connected to the 
		  input of another does not imply that the ouput of this second LUT is connected to
		  the input of the first LUT
	
	- Connections matrix (Might not implement this)
		- Represents the ACTUAL connections for LUTs
		- Current plan is to handle these connections locally (i.e. inside instances of the LUT class)
			so most likely this redundant representation will get scrapped
